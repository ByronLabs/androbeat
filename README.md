## Description

**Androbeat Agent** is an Android application that collects data from an Android device and securely sends it to a Elasticsearch instance. It captures device telemetry and operational data and forwards it to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis.

## Features

- Automatic data collection from sensors and logs
- Secure data transmission to configurable servers
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Integration with Elasticsearch
- Built-in instrumentation

## Supported Sensors and Data Sources

- AccelerometerSensor
- GyroscopeSensor
- LightSensor
- MagneticSensor
- PressureSensor
- ProximitySensor
- HumiditySensor
- RotationSensor
- StepsSensor
- NetworkStatistics
- CpuStatistics
- AppStatistics
- BatteryStatistics
- WifiConnectedInfo
- WifiList
- BasicConfiguration
- CellTower
- BtList
- EnvironmentVariables
- RamStatistics

## Configuration

## Data Collection Notice

The Androbeat Agent optionally requests permission from the user to collect detailed usage data in order to enhance system monitoring and analytics.  
Users can deny this permission; however, if denied, the agent will operate with limited data collection, resulting in reduced metrics being uploaded to the backend.

### Local Properties

Create a `local.properties` file in the project root with the following variables:

- `ELASTIC_HOST`: Elastic Cloud host URL
- `ELASTIC_USER`: Username for Elastic Cloud
- `ELASTIC_PASS`: Password for Elastic Cloud
- `DEBUG_EXTRACTORS`: Enable/disable debug logging for data extractors (`true`/`false`)
- `DEBUG_RETROFIT`: Enable/disable debug logging for Retrofit (`true`/`false`)
- `DEBUG_SENSORS`: Enable/disable debug logging for sensors (`true`/`false`)
- `READ_LOGS`: Enable/disable reading logs (`true`/`false`)
- `ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`: Token for local authentication, requested when the application starts.

## Dependencies

Main dependencies include:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX (Lifecycle, Compose, Navigation, etc.)
- Retrofit & OkHttp
- Dagger Hilt
- Room
- Firebase Crashlytics
- MockK & Mockito (testing)

For the full list of dependencies and their versions, see [`app/build.gradle.kts`](app/build.gradle.kts).

> **Note:** Instrumentation tests require an emulator or device with API level 26 or higher.
